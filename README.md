ðŸ‘‹ Hi, thanks for visiting! I'm Rosie, a Data Visualization Designer. As a born and raised New Yorker, I was surrounded by art, people, and stories which eventually culminated into a love for design and data. I have a background in graphic design but a strong interest and pull towards interactive front-end coding, which I've been working on and learning. My love for data and design bleeds into my free time but focuses on more obscure content like the muppets, sports, and the various things I wonder. 
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, D3, and Vue.
